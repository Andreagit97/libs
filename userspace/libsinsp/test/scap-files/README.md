# Scap-file tests

In the folder `/captures` there are all the scap-files used in these tests.
For each scap-file in this folder, we have a dedicated folder (called like the scap-file) which contains:

- the test file `.cpp`
- a `README.md` file with the description of the test and a pstree-like output.
