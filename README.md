falcosecurity/libs
======

**Status**: *Work in progress*

As per the [OSS Libraries Donation Plan](https://github.com/falcosecurity/falco/blob/master/proposals/2021019-libraries-donation.md), this repository has been chosen to be the new home for **libsinsp**, **libscap**, the **kernel module driver** and the **eBPF driver sources** which Sysdig Inc. has donated to the Falco project.

The above-mentioned libraries and drivers have been originally developed as parts of the [draios/sysdig](https://github.com/draios/sysdig) repository and will be migrated into this repository soon.

Please, **DO NOT use this repository** until the migration has been completed. We will update this document and make an announcement when ready.
